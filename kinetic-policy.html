        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Accelerometer Data:</strong> The game uses your device's accelerometer for gameplay control only.
                This data is processed in real-time on your device and is <strong>never</strong> stored, collected, or
                transmitted off the device.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Local Storage:</strong> The app uses local storage (SharedPreferences) to save your top 3 high
                scores and the corresponding "Sand Art" images. This data is stored <strong>only on your own device</strong>
                and is not accessible to us or any third parties.
